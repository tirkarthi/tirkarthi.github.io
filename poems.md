### Dream girl

A girl from north  
Programs in Forth  
Filled with trust  
Rewrites habits in Rust  
Always stays nearby  
Perfectly compatible ABI  
Won't let me bore  
Soft tender Core  
Makes life fit  
Surprises me like Git  
Will eventually find one though  
Will never let her Go  

### Life as a JS developer

First date with a Cadbury  
Here dear, have more jQuery  
I bought home a cat  
I like how you React  
You poured love like a shower  
You are essential like Bower  
You made a great impact  
I will build our love with Webpack  
I imagine about our special day venue  
Baby I will write it in Vue  
You will see me as peculiar  
But I love my Mercurial  
I will never leave you even in a whim  
Because you helped me exit damn Vim  

### Life as a QA

When developers were at pandemonium  
She filed more bugs with selenium  
In the meantime, opened IE8 in a random frame  
div is not centered, let's start the UI game  
Rolled her eyes over the blueish pixel  
Not very blueish, a bug goes to her excel  
Hits the REST endpoint at her best  
A server error brings her hands rest  
513 bugs for the day and suggested few features  
Do we the developers look like weird creatures?  

### Agile mornings

My mornings were fragile  
You made me more Agile  
Love is life's fulcrum  
You whispered at the Scrum  
You offered a different perspective  
When I was worried at Retrospective  
Yet, three days and just wrote "int"  
That's my story for the Sprint  

### node_modules folder

It will be great one day  
He told her  
Angular 2 incompatible with Angular 4  
His face became pale and colder  
Just another framework to learn  
She pat on his shoulder  
Opened medium modern JavaScript for dinosaur  
He felt a little bit older  
Depressed and devastated, he jumped off the cliff  
Fell and died inside his node_modules folder  

### Friday fixes

When the sun shines  
Make hay they say  
Filled with darkness  
Alone in the bay  
Looks at the regression report  
To see what does it say  
5k chars in a character field  
DIV is pushed far away  
Losing faith in humanity  
Day by day  
Cringes at the bug saying aloud  
Never push a fix by Friday
