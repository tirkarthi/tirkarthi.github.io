# Read from resource (file/socket)


```
while True:
    data = resource.read(100) # Read 100 bytes
    
    if not data:
        break
     
    process(data)

``` 
---

# PEP 572

* New operator :=  (Unnamed yet)
* Use assignment expressions in boolean context

```

while (data := resource.read(100)):
    process(data)

```

---

# Get something from map


```
value = map.get("foo") # Can return 0

if value is not None:
    do_something(value)
```

PEP 572

```
if (value := map.get("foo")) is not None:
    do_something(value)
```

---

# Regex matching

```python
pattern = re.compile(r'(\d+)')
match = pattern.match(data)

if match:
    result = match.group(1)
```

---

```python
pattern = re.compile(r'(\d+)')

if (match := pattern.match(data)):
    result = match.group(1)
```
---

# List comprehensions


```
[square(n) for n in range(1, 10) if square(n) / 2 == 0]
```

PEP 572

```
[res for n in range(1, 10) if (res := square(n)) / 2 == 0]
```
