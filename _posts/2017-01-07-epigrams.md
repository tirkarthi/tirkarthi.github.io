*Variables in a program are much more reliable than a few people in life*

A few epigrams about life and programming.

- Surround your relationships with transactions that rollback memories on an IntegrityError
- Loss of context in threads makes the thread useless
- Periodically reboot yourself for your own sanity and well-being. You are not a damn server
- Never POST your thoughts to an endpoint unless its secure and trustworthy
- Be with people who shares your interface
- Being abstract and thinking another abstract class will complete you never works
- Concurrent modification of shared memory leads to corruption
- Don't let people treat you like a rubber duck for their own problems
- People who behave the same way in same situations are important. Referential transparency matters all the time
- Having a hundred shortcut icons that never work in your desktop clutters the beauty of your life
- Trying to access a freed memory results in segfaults
- Don't let unwanted processes read/write to your memory and make a clusterfuck out of yourself
- Sometimes you have to call System.gc() forcefully and let GC do the magic
- Open source only to those who respect it or else you will be the scapegoat for someone else's free lunch
- Don't pass yourself by reference unless you deeply trust the function. Learn to value your own values
- Its better to sleep than to be an idle workstation
- One man’s constant is another man’s variable - Alan J. Perlis

**A dumb syntactical mistake never means the end of life. Edit the file. Recompile and move on with responsibility and care. That's the beauty of programming and life**

Keep calm and code with :heart:
