I am karthikeyan. I write Python for food and fun at day and its mostly clojure in these nocturnal nights. I fell in love with programming when I got amazed by monads and endfunctors. Type level shenanigans blew my mind. Ofcourse thats crazy. I program because its fun. When it doesn't I eat dosa and sleep. I always look forward to learn and tackle interesting things though they beat me down to knees very easily.

Oh yes! I do have a life!

Not a great designer by the way the whole blog is possible due to the work of Jekyll.
