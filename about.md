I am Karthikeyan. I got introduced to computers by 13, the age of marquee tags and IE. I am an autodidact. I have been programming professionally since 2014. I write Python for food and fun at day and mostly clojure in these nocturnal nights.  This blog started about programming and then turned about to be a personal blog about my mistakes and opinions :) 

Flavour of music for code : Linkin Park, Eminem and A.R. Rahman 

*"You got to find what you love.. And like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on" - Steve Jobs, Stanford Commencement*

Oh yes! I do have a life!

Not a great designer by the way the whole blog is possible due to the work of Jekyll.
