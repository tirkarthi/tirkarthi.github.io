Hey there!

I am Karthikeyan. I got introduced to computers by 13, the age of marquee tags and IE. I am a self-taught developer. I have been programming professionally since 2014. I write Python for food and fun at day. I mostly use Clojure outside work. In terms of food, I love dosa, koala biryani (Thalapakati) and plain Vanilla (Not vanilla JavaScript though :). I Reddit a lot. I occassionally read books with stoicism, (auto)?biographies and short novels being my picks. This blog started about programming and then turned about to be a personal blog about my mistakes and opinions. I mostly write here openly in a way that I can look back my life about both progress and mistakes. So you might find some posts interesting and others depressing. I also write [poems with puns](/poems/) and [draw comics](/comics/)

Flavour of music for code :

* Linkin Park
* Eminem
* A.R. Rahman

You can reach out to me at below and I will get back to you for sure!

Oh yes! I do have a life!

Not a great designer by the way the whole blog is possible due to the work of Jekyll.
